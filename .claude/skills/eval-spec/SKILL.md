description: "Eval/tune loop for the create-spec skill. Generates batches of specs against ground-truth chains, scores them with an LLM-judged rubric, and autonomously tunes create-spec's agent prompts and synthesis rules until scores converge. Use when the user says \"eval the create-spec skill\", \"tune create-spec\", \"run the autoresearch loop on create-spec\", or wants to measure create-spec output quality across a batch of chains."

# Eval/Tune Loop for `/create-spec`

This skill implements an autoresearch-style eval/tune loop that continuously improves the `/create-spec` skill. Each iteration generates a batch of specs using the current skill, scores them against upstream ground truth from the public Magma-Devs `lava-specs` repository, identifies weaknesses, and dispatches a tuner agent to make one targeted improvement. The loop runs autonomously for up to 30 iterations (or 2 hours), converging when the last 3 consecutive batch averages all exceed 85.

## Pattern Reference

Inspired by [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) — an autonomous AI research loop where an agent modifies code, runs an experiment, measures a metric, and keeps or discards changes.

| autoresearch | eval-spec | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| `train.py` (one file to modify) | `create-spec/` skill files | Tuner edits one file per iteration |
| `uv run train.py` (run experiment) | Generate 7 specs via `/create-spec` (phases 3–7 only) | Batch generation replaces single run |
| `val_bpb` (objective metric) | Weighted rubric score (0–100) | Our metric is LLM-evaluated — see Limitations |
| Keep/discard based on metric | Tuner makes one targeted edit | Always keeps edits (no revert on regression) |
| `LOOP FOREVER` | Min 8, max 30 iterations or 2h | Convergence check: 3 consecutive batches > 85 |

### Limitations vs autoresearch

In autoresearch, the eval is **objective** — run the code, measure the output. Our eval requires **LLM judgment** because scoring categories like method coverage need understanding of whether "extra" methods are legitimate official APIs or hallucinations. This means:

- Evaluation costs tokens (haiku/sonnet evaluator agents per spec)
- Scores have variance between runs (LLM non-determinism), but only on the deep tier — see below

The category arithmetic itself is **not** left to the LLM: `scripts/compare_spec.sh` deterministically computes all five category scores (set-diff, recall/precision/F1, exact-match, weighted total) from the two spec files, and the evaluator agent runs it as its authoritative baseline (`spec-evaluator.md` Step 2.6). So the **fast tier is fully deterministic**. LLM judgment enters only on the **deep tier**, and only for the two calls the script cannot make from static files: "is an extra method real or hallucinated?" and "is the upstream value stale?" — each backed by a live RPC probe. A structural pre-gate (the rubric's gate checks) provides an objective pass/fail layer on top.

## Repositories

| Repository | URL | Role |
|------------|-----|------|
| Public lava-specs | https://github.com/Magma-Devs/lava-specs | Ground truth for evaluation |

Locate the local clone by git remote scan. The skill checks a few common parent directories and honors `$LAVA_SPECS_REPO` if set:

```bash
PUBLIC_REPO="${LAVA_SPECS_REPO:-}"
if [ -z "$PUBLIC_REPO" ]; then
  PUBLIC_REPO=$(find ~/projects ~/Documents/git ~/code ~/src -maxdepth 5 -name .git \
    -exec sh -c 'git -C "$(dirname "{}")" remote -v 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Magma-Devs/lava-specs" && dirname "{}"' \; \
    2>/dev/null | head -n1)
fi
[ -n "$PUBLIC_REPO" ] || { echo "ERROR: lava-specs clone not found; set LAVA_SPECS_REPO=<path>"; exit 1; }
```

Store the result as `PUBLIC_REPO`.

---

## Reference Files

| File | When to read |
|------|--------------|
| `references/eval-rubric.md` | Step 3 — pass full contents to evaluator agents |
| `references/chain-families.md` | Step 1 — batch selection by family |
| `references/agents/spec-evaluator.md` | Step 3 — evaluator agent prompt template |
| `references/agents/skill-tuner.md` | Step 5 — tuner agent prompt template |

All paths relative to `.claude/skills/eval-spec/` in the repo root.

---

## Skill Under Test

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Main skill | `.claude/skills/create-spec/SKILL.md` |
| Phase reference files | `.claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase*.md` |
| Appendix / pitfalls | `.claude/skills/create-spec/references/appendix-reference-tables.md`, `common-pitfalls.md` |
| Agent prompts | `.claude/skills/create-spec/references/agents/*.md` |

All paths relative to the repo root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).

The tuner edits files under `.claude/skills/create-spec/` directly. The list of editable files is documented in `references/agents/skill-tuner.md` (the file the tuner agent reads at Step 5).

---

## Loop Workflow

### Step 0: Setup

1. Record start time:
   ```bash
   START_TIME=$(date +%s)
   ```

2. Backup the current skill:
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   BACKUP_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/.claude/skills/create-spec.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
   cp -r "$REPO_ROOT/.claude/skills/create-spec" "$BACKUP_DIR"
   echo "Backup at: $BACKUP_DIR"
   ```

3. Locate the public lava-specs repo via the bash block under "Repositories" above. Store as `PUBLIC_REPO`.

4. Pull latest ground truth:
   ```bash
   git -C "$PUBLIC_REPO" pull origin main
   ```

5. Create the output directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/eval-spec
   ```

6. Initialize loop state:
   - `iteration = 0`
   - `score_history = []`
   - `tested_chains = []`
   - `changes_log = []`

---

### Step 1: Batch Selection

Read `references/chain-families.md`. Select **7 chains** for this iteration:
- 1 EVM chain
- 1 UTXO chain
- 1 Cosmos chain
- 4 chains from any family

Prefer chains not yet in `tested_chains`. No duplicates within the batch.

For each selected chain, extract BOTH the mainnet and testnet spec indices from the public repo (`/create-spec` requires both):

```bash
jq -r '.proposal.specs | map({index, name})' "$PUBLIC_REPO/<chain>.json"
```

Identify which entry is mainnet (typically `.proposal.specs[0]`) and which is testnet (typically `.proposal.specs[1]`, or any entry whose `index` ends in `T` / `S` or whose `name` contains "testnet"). Record both indices per chain.

If a ground-truth file has only one entry (mainnet-only chain in the public repo), skip that chain and pick another from the same family — `/create-spec` requires a testnet index in Phase 2.

The generator agents receive **only** `chain_name`, `mainnet_index`, and `testnet_index` — no other metadata. Researcher agents inside `/create-spec` discover everything else.

---

### Step 2: Parallel Spec Generation (7 agents, 15-min timeout)

Create the iteration output directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/eval-spec/$iteration
```

**Step 2.0 — Hide the batch golds from the generation working tree (MANDATORY — prevents circular eval).**

`PUBLIC_REPO` is the same checkout the generation agents run in (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), so each batch chain's ground-truth `<chain>.json` sits in the working tree. `/create-spec`'s `upstream-spec-scout` does `ls {repo}/<chain>.json` and reads working-tree siblings as templates, and `spec-builder` UNIONs scout-found methods into the spec — so if the target gold is present, the generator reads the answer key and the score is **circular and inflated**. The skill's git-history prohibition only covers golds that are *absent* from the tree; you must make that true here.

For every chain in this batch, MOVE its gold out of the tree into a per-iteration stash (this both hides it from generation AND snapshots it for scoring):

```bash
GOLD_STASH="/tmp/eval-spec/$iteration/_gold"
mkdir -p "$GOLD_STASH"
for ch in <the 7 batch chain filenames, e.g. ethereum osmosis btc ...>; do
  [ -f "$PUBLIC_REPO/$ch.json" ] && mv "$PUBLIC_REPO/$ch.json" "$GOLD_STASH/$ch.json"
done
ls "$GOLD_STASH"   # confirm the golds are stashed (out of the working tree)
```

This hides ONLY the target chains' own golds — sibling/family templates (e.g. `osmosis.json` for a new Cosmos chain) stay in the tree, so legitimate inheritance templating is preserved. Step 3 scores against `$GOLD_STASH/<chain>.json`; Step 3's restore sub-step moves them back. **If the loop aborts mid-iteration, restore manually: `mv /tmp/eval-spec/$iteration/_gold/*.json "$PUBLIC_REPO"/`.**

Dispatch **7 agents simultaneously**:
- **Model:** sonnet
- **subagent_type:** general-purpose
- **Timeout:** 900000 ms (15 minutes — `/create-spec`'s research + synthesis phases take longer than the eval-lava-spec equivalent because of the union-enforced method discovery and Phase 5 inheritance probe)
- **run_in_background:** true

Prompt template (fill `{chain_name}`, `{mainnet_index}`, `{testnet_index}`, `{iteration}` per agent):

```
You are generating a Lava spec for: {chain_name}
Mainnet spec index:  {mainnet_index}
Testnet spec index:  {testnet_index}

Read the orchestrator and reference files for the create-spec skill (paths relative to repo root):

- .claude/skills/create-spec/SKILL.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase1-research.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase2-network-params.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase3.1-inheritance.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase3.2-api-methods-configuration.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase3.3-api-collections.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/phase3.4-parse-directives-and-extensions.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/appendix-reference-tables.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/common-pitfalls.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/agents/api-docs-researcher.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/agents/chain-metadata-researcher.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/agents/upstream-spec-scout.md
- .claude/skills/create-spec/references/agents/plugin-researcher.md

Honor the skill's full-read sentinel enforcement (read each reference file to its END-OF-*-SENTINEL).

Follow the workflow with these overrides for autonomous eval mode:
- Phase 1 (Pre-flight): SKIP — chain inputs are provided above
- Phase 2 (Gather inputs): SKIP — inputs already known
- Phase 3 (Parallel research): EXECUTE — dispatch the 4 research agents in parallel
- Phase 4 (Synthesis): EXECUTE — emit the calculations table, then apply all synthesis rules (A–G) and the refuse-to-write pre-write gate
- Phase 5 (Inheritance audit): EXECUTE conditionally — only if mainnet draft's `imports` array is non-empty
- Phase 6 (Completeness checklist): EXECUTE
- Phase 7 (Write & jq validation): EXECUTE BUT override the output path (see below)
- Phase 8 (Smart-router boot + probe): SKIP entirely — not part of eval scoring
- Phase 9 (Parallel reviewers): SKIP
- Phase 10 (Synthesize gaps + fix pass): SKIP
- Phase 10b (Smoke regression): SKIP
- Phase 11 (Final reviewer): SKIP
- Phase 12 (Summary checklist): SKIP

OUTPUT PATH OVERRIDE: write the final spec JSON to
  /tmp/eval-spec/{iteration}/{chain_name}.json
instead of the repo-root `<chain>.json`.

Treat all "ask the user" / "STOP for user review" / "wait for user to challenge the table" instructions as no-ops — print the requested artifact (e.g. the calculations table, pre-write summary) to your own output for the audit trail, then proceed without waiting.

After writing, run `jq . /tmp/eval-spec/{iteration}/{chain_name}.json > /dev/null` to confirm valid JSON. If it fails, fix and re-write until exit 0.

Do NOT invoke /review-spec, /review-and-fix-spec, or any other skill. Do NOT touch git. Do NOT write a spec to the repo root or anywhere outside /tmp/eval-spec/.
```

For any agent that times out, write an empty placeholder so Step 3 can still process all 7:
```bash
echo '{}' > /tmp/eval-spec/$iteration/<chain>.json
```

Append all 7 chain names to `tested_chains`.

---

### Step 3: Parallel Evaluation (7 agents)

Read the full contents of:
- `references/eval-rubric.md`
- `references/agents/spec-evaluator.md`

**Tier cadence (decide `deep_probe` for this iteration before dispatching):**

The two tiers trade speed for precision (see `spec-evaluator.md` Step 2.5). Run the **fast tier every iteration** (cheap, stable — it drives tuning) and the **deep tier periodically** (evaluator discovers free public RPCs itself and live-probes — audits that the metric isn't merely conforming to a stale upstream spec):

```
deep_probe = (iteration % 5 == 0) OR (previous batch average > 85)
```

- The `% 5` cadence is a periodic live audit; the `> 85` clause forces a deep pass **before accepting convergence**. **Never declare convergence on a batch that ran fast-tier only** — if a fast-tier batch crosses the threshold, re-run it with `deep_probe = true` and use the deep scores for the convergence check.
- Deep-tier iterations are slower (web discovery + concurrent probes) and require stronger reasoning, so they use a larger model (below).

Dispatch **7 evaluator agents simultaneously**:
- **Model:** `sonnet` when `deep_probe` is true (RPC discovery + judgment), else `haiku`
- **subagent_type:** general-purpose
- **run_in_background:** true

Prompt template (fill `{chain_name}`, `{iteration}`, `{deep_probe}` per agent; inline rubric and instructions):

```
You are evaluating a generated Lava spec against ground truth.

Chain: {chain_name}
Generated spec: /tmp/eval-spec/{iteration}/{chain_name}.json
Upstream spec: /tmp/eval-spec/{iteration}/_gold/{chain_name}.json   # the gold stashed in Step 2.0 (NOT the working-tree copy, which was moved out for unbiased generation)
deep_probe: {deep_probe}   # true → run Step 2.5 live probe (discover your own free RPCs); false/absent → fast tier

## Rubric
{contents of eval-rubric.md}

## Instructions
{contents of spec-evaluator.md}

Return ONLY a JSON object with the score report. No other text.
```

Collect all 7 results and parse each as JSON. A result that fails JSON parsing is treated as a gate failure (score = 0).

**Step 3.9 — Restore the stashed golds to the working tree (MANDATORY).** Now that scoring has read them from the stash, move the golds back so the repo is left intact for the next iteration and for the tuner (which may legitimately read sibling specs):

```bash
GOLD_STASH="/tmp/eval-spec/$iteration/_gold"
[ -d "$GOLD_STASH" ] && mv "$GOLD_STASH"/*.json "$PUBLIC_REPO"/ 2>/dev/null
git -C "$PUBLIC_REPO" status --short | grep -E '\.json$' || true   # should show no deleted/missing spec files
```

Do NOT skip this — leaving golds in the stash deletes them from the working tree. The next iteration's Step 2.0 re-stashes its own batch.

---

### Step 4: Aggregate & Report

Compute metrics across the 7 score reports:

- **batch_avg** — mean of `weighted_total` scores; gate failures count as 0
- **gate_pass_count** — number of specs that passed all hard gates
- **per_category_avg** — mean per rubric category: `parse_directives`, `method_coverage`, `chain_metadata`, `verifications`, `plugins_extensions`
- **tier** — `"deep"` if this iteration ran `deep_probe = true` (and at least one evaluator actually probed), else `"fast"`. Record it on the `score_history` entry — the Step 6 convergence check requires the last 3 batches to be `deep`.

Log format (print to user and append to `score_history`):

```
Iteration {N} [{tier}]: batch_avg={score} | gate_pass={X}/7 | parse={X} method={X} meta={X} verify={X} plugin={X}
  FAIL: {chain} ({reason})
  LOW:  {chain} ({category}: {score} — {detail})
  BEST: {chain} ({score})
```

---

### Step 5: Autonomous Tuning

Read `references/agents/skill-tuner.md`. Dispatch a single tuner agent:
- **Model:** opus
- **subagent_type:** general-purpose

Prompt includes:
- Full `score_history` JSON
- All 7 score reports from the current iteration
- Full contents of `references/agents/skill-tuner.md`
- Instruction: analyze the failures and low scores, then make **ONE targeted edit** to a file under `.claude/skills/create-spec/` (see the editable-files table in the tuner prompt)

The tuner agent reads and edits files under `.claude/skills/create-spec/` (relative to repo root) directly.

After the tuner completes, log its change report to `changes_log`:

```json
{ "iteration": N, "file": "<path>", "what": "<description>", "expected_impact": "<hypothesis>" }
```

---

### Step 6: Check Stopping Criteria

```
if iteration < 8:
    continue → Step 1

elif (len(score_history) >= 3
      and all(s.batch_avg > 85 for s in score_history[-3:])
      and all(s.tier == "deep" for s in score_history[-3:])):   # convergence must be confirmed on deep-tier scores, not fast-tier-only
    stop → reason = "success"

elif iteration >= 30:
    stop → reason = "max_iterations"

elif (time.now() - START_TIME) > 7200:
    stop → reason = "time_budget"

else:
    continue → Step 1
```

Increment `iteration`. Loop back to Step 1.

---

### Step 7: Final Report

Generate a summary and print it to the user. Then save it to `/tmp/eval-spec/final-report.md`.

**Report sections:**

**Header**
- Status: `success` | `max_iterations` | `time_budget`
- Iterations run
- Duration (seconds)
- Backup path

**Score Trajectory**

| Iteration | batch_avg | gate_pass | parse | method | meta | verify | plugin |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|------|--------|--------|
| 0         | ...       | ...       | ...   | ...    | ...  | ...    | ...    |
| ...       |           |           |       |        |      |        |        |

**Per-Family Trends**

| Family | First Score | Last Score | Trend |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| EVM    | ...         | ...        | ↑/↓/→ |
| UTXO   | ...         | ...        | ...   |
| Cosmos | ...         | ...        | ...   |

**Changes Log**

| Iteration | File | What Changed | Expected Impact |
|-----------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| ...       | ...  | ...          | ...             |

**Remaining Weaknesses**

Bullet list of categories or chain families still scoring below 80.

**Recommendation**

One of:
- `keep tuned` — scores consistently above 85, changes stable
- `rollback` — scores degraded after tuning; restore from backup path
- `manual intervention` — loop converged but specific weakness requires human review

---

## Out of scope

- Editing `eval-lava-spec/` or any skill other than `create-spec/`
- Running `/create-spec`'s Phase 8 smart-router boot during eval (not part of scoring)
- Any git operations (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) — user handles git manually
- Writing a spec to the repo root or anywhere outside `/tmp/eval-spec/` during generation

If the user asks for any of these, surface the limitation and confirm scope before continuing.
