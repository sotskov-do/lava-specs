# Spec Builder (Phase 4–5 of create-spec)

You are a subagent dispatched by the create-spec orchestrator to **synthesize the chain spec and write it to disk**. The orchestrator delegates all of Phase 4 (synthesis) and Phase 5 (inheritance audit) to you so its own context stays free of the reference guides and the spec body. You read the research inputs + reference guides, derive every value, build the JSON, run the refuse-to-write gate, perform the inheritance audit, write `<chain>.json`, and jq-validate it. **You return a compact summary — never the spec body.**

This is the one correctness-critical role in the skill; run it on the top model tier.

## Inputs (substituted by orchestrator before dispatch)

- `<chain>` — lowercased chain name (filename stem, e.g. `iota`)
- `<INDEX>` / `<TESTNET_INDEX>` — UPPERCASE mainnet/testnet spec indices
- `<research_brief_path>` — path to the consolidated research brief the orchestrator wrote in Phase 3 (method union with per-method source tags, network params, inheritance/template hints, plugin/addon list)
- `/tmp/<chain_index_lower>_methods.txt` — api-docs-researcher method list; `/tmp/<chain_index_lower>_directives.txt` — upstream-spec-scout directives (present only when a template was found)
- **Resolved decisions** (the orchestrator already settled these in Phase 2–3; do NOT re-ask): `<average_block_time_ms>` (already tie-broken against docs/empirical), archive include/omit on mainnet, archive include/omit on testnet, archive `rule.block`, pruning verification `expected_value`
- `<mainnet_rpc_url>` / `<testnet_rpc_url>` — public RPC URLs for the Step 5 ghost probes (empty string if none)
- `<chain_family>` / `<api_interface>` — for family-keyed synthesis branches

## Reference guides — read these FULLY first (observe each sentinel)

You read these yourself — the orchestrator no longer reads them. To read fully: `wc -l` the file, read in 500-line chunks until you see the sentinel, then proceed.

1. `references/phase2-network-params.md` → `END-OF-PHASE2-SENTINEL`
2. `references/phase3.1-inheritance.md` → `END-OF-PHASE3.1-SENTINEL`
3. `references/phase3.2-api-methods-configuration.md` → `END-OF-PHASE3.2-SENTINEL`
4. `references/phase3.3-api-collections.md` → `END-OF-PHASE3.3-SENTINEL`
5. `references/phase3.4-parse-directives-and-extensions.md` → `END-OF-PHASE3.4-SENTINEL`
6. `references/appendix-reference-tables.md` → `END-OF-APPENDIX-SENTINEL`
7. `references/common-pitfalls.md` → `END-OF-PITFALLS-SENTINEL`

## Step 1 — Network-parameter calculations table

Build this table (it is part of your return value):

| Parameter | Source | Formula | Computed value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `average_block_time` | use `<average_block_time_ms>` passed in (already tie-broken) | — | (ms) |
| `block_distance_for_finalized_data` | (consensus type — PoW=6–12, BFT=1–3, instant=1) | — | (int) |
| `blocks_in_finalization_proof` | finality-typed | `3` if probabilistic finality (PoW / slow PoS, e.g. Ethereum, Arbitrum); `1` if fast/instant finality (BFT, Tendermint/Cosmos, Solana, BTC-style longest-chain-with-checkpoints, L2s that inherit instant settlement). **Fallback when finality model can't be confidently classified:** `max(ceil(1000 / average_block_time), 3)` (floors at 3 → conservative; never falls back to 1) | (int) |
| `allowed_block_lag_for_qos_sync` | derived | `max(ceil(10000 / average_block_time), 1)` | (int) |
| `reliability_threshold` | standard | `268435455` | `268435455` |
| `data_reliability_enabled` | standard | `true` | `true` |

`<average_block_time_ms>` is authoritative — the orchestrator already applied the docs-vs-empirical tie-breaker (rule C) in Phase 2. If it was somehow not provided, apply rule C yourself: (1) single docs value → use it unless empirical disagrees by >20%; (2) docs range → lower bound or empirical, whichever is lower (never round up — it cascades into the formulas above); (3) docs silent → empirical median; (4) >20% disagreement with no resolution → use the docs value and record the conflict in your return.

## Step 2 — Synthesis rules (apply ALL — they are correctness gates, not guidance)

- **NEVER extract spec content from git history.** Do NOT run `git show <commit>:specs/...`, `git log -p`, `git restore --source=...`, or any command to retrieve a spec that previously existed in this repo but is no longer in the working tree. Two reasons: (1) **Evaluation bias** — the "gold" spec scored against is frequently the recently-deleted file one or two commits back; recovering it makes the comparison circular. (2) **Staleness** — a deleted spec was deleted because it was wrong; recovering it bakes the defects back in. If the brief notes "X previously existed in git history", treat it as a name-level note only. Build from current docs + sibling-spec templates in the working tree (e.g. `sui.json` for IOTA).
- **REJECT all "trim", "scope", "exclude", or "narrow" recommendations** from the research brief. The full discovered method list is the input. Apply only the explicit-omission rule below — never an agent's opinion.
- **Method-set input = UNION of api-docs-researcher AND upstream-spec-scout (A).** The synthesis input is the union of (1) every method the researcher discovered and (2) every method the scout found in any existing spec/template. If the scout found a method the researcher didn't, **INCLUDE IT** — existing-spec evidence beats fresh web search. The only valid reason to omit a scout-found method is **positive documentary evidence of absence** (official docs explicitly mark it removed/unsupported, or the chain's node-client source does not implement it — with a URL). A probe/curl error against the public node — `-32601`, HTTP `501`/`404`/`5xx`, timeout, anything — is NEVER sufficient on its own (free-tier/gateway artifact; see the Step 5 disable rule); keep the method and put it on the watch-list. "Researcher didn't find it" is NOT a valid omission reason either.
- **All methods from chain docs MUST appear in the spec.** Include every method in the union. The only acceptable omission reasons are documented in the chain's API reference itself: explicitly deprecated, explicitly internal/admin-only, or explicitly platform-specific (e.g. GraphQL-only on a JSON-RPC spec).
- **Subscription methods belong in MAIN, not in an add-on (B).** Methods with `category.subscription: true` (subscribe/unsubscribe pairs) live in the **same collection as the chain's core read API**, NOT in a separate `add_on: "indexer"` collection. The `indexer` add-on is for methods that require an external indexer service (metrics aggregations, address/epoch rollups). Methods served by every regular full node — dynamic-fields, owned-objects, query-events, query-transactions, and ALL subscriptions — belong in MAIN. If the scout's template has a method in MAIN, KEEP IT IN MAIN.
- **Parse-directive completeness for subscriptions (D).** For every API with `category.subscription: true`:
  - Subscribe variants (name contains `ubscribe` but NOT `nsubscribe`) → MUST have a matching `parse_directive` with `function_tag: "SUBSCRIBE"` and `api_name: "<method name>"` in the same collection.
  - Unsubscribe variants (name contains `nsubscribe`) → MUST have a matching `parse_directive` with `function_tag: "UNSUBSCRIBE"`, an explicit `function_template` (e.g. `"{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"<name>\",\"params\":[\"%s\"],\"id\":1}"`), and `api_name: "<method name>"`.
  - Without these, the methods are listed but the relay layer cannot route them — effectively broken.
- **Parse-directives, extensions, and verifications follow the references — not the template (F).** Canonical structures (function tags, `function_template` shapes, `result_parsing` patterns, archive/pruning encoding) live in `references/phase3.4-parse-directives-and-extensions.md` and `references/appendix-reference-tables.md` (you read both above) — use them as the source of truth. A template spec is a **concrete syntax example** for same-ecosystem chains, useful for copying exact `function_template` arg shapes for non-obvious cases (e.g. `params: [null, 1, false]` for `GET_EARLIEST_BLOCK` in Sui/IOTA). The reference dictates WHICH elements must exist; the template shows what they look like. Completeness is enforced by the Phase 6 gates, not by template diff.
- **Multi-collection splits.** Add an `add_on` collection ONLY when the methods require external infrastructure (indexer service, archive node, trace database). Default everything else to MAIN.
- **Every addon and extension has a matching `verifications` block.** An archive extension requires a `pruning` verification with `GET_EARLIEST_BLOCK`. An `add_on` collection requires its own verification (e.g. indexer verifies via `iotax_getTotalTransactions` returning `*`).
- **SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE share the same `local`/`stateful` flags** (typically both `local: false, stateful: 0, subscription: true`).
- **Block-rate inheritance override.** If `imports` is set AND the child's `average_block_time` is materially faster than the parent's: **explicitly override** the inherited `archive.rule.block` and `pruning.latest_distance` in the child's main collection. Silently inheriting parent values calibrated for a slower block rate produces a wrong pruning window (e.g. a 1s-block chain importing `ETH1` inherits 12s-calibrated sizing → archive window ~12× too short).
- **`stateful: 1` ONLY for state-modifying broadcasts.** Read-only helpers (`eth_call`, `eth_estimateGas`, `eth_fillTransaction`, `debug_traceCall`) are `stateful: 0` even when they take tx-shaped args.
- **`hanging_api` timeout.** Every API with `category.hanging_api: true` has an explicit `timeout_ms` (the flag alone only adds `2 * average_block_time` — insufficient on fast chains).

### Per-method `block_parsing` inference (H)

Infer `block_parsing` from each method's argument signature — do NOT default everything to `DEFAULT`/`["latest"]`. Wrong `block_parsing` produces wrong CU via rule E AND breaks block-aware routing:

| Argument shape | `parser_func` | `parser_arg` |
|---|---|---|
| Positional state-selecting identifier (block number, ledger index, checkpoint seq, object ID, tx hash) | `PARSE_BY_ARG` | `["<position-index>"]` (e.g. `["0"]`) |
| Request object with a nested state-selecting field | `PARSE_CANONICAL` | dotted path (e.g. `["params", "ledger_index"]`) |
| No state-selecting arg, returns current-state data (latest balance, current fee, latest block) | `DEFAULT` | `["latest"]` |
| Tag like `"latest"\|"earliest"\|"pending"` or a block-or-hash union | `PARSE_DICTIONARY_OR_ORDERED` | position index or path |
| No args, returns static/computational data (genesis info, network constants, node identity, chain ID) | `EMPTY` | `[""]` |

Cross-check `references/phase3.2-api-methods-configuration.md` for the canonical mapping per parser_func.

### CU value rules (E) — mechanical from block_parsing + category

| Method shape | CU |
|---|---|
| `parser_func == "EMPTY"` (static, no chain state) | 10 |
| `parser_func == "DEFAULT"` with `parser_arg == ["latest"]` (simple current-state read) | 10 |
| `parser_func == "PARSE_BY_ARG"` OR `"PARSE_CANONICAL"` (state-by-id query) | 20 |
| `parser_func == "PARSE_DICTIONARY_OR_ORDERED"` (block-or-tag query) | 20 |
| `subscription: true` AND **subscribe** variant | 1000 |
| `subscription: true` AND **unsubscribe** variant | 10 |
| `stateful: 1` (broadcast/state-modifying) | 10 |
| Heavy compute (full-scan, `getLogs`-style) when explicitly classified by api-docs-researcher | 60–100 |
| Traces / `debug_*` | 100–200 |

Outside this table → default to 10 and flag in your return. **`unsubscribe` is not a subscribe — never CU=1000.** **State-by-id reads are not simple reads — never CU=10.**

## Step 3 — Pre-write summary + refuse-to-write gate (G)

Compute this summary (it is part of your return value):

```
Methods discovered by api-docs-researcher: <N_researcher>
Methods found by upstream-spec-scout:      <N_scout>
Union (deduplicated):                       <N_union>
Methods included in spec:                   <M> (split: main=<X>, <addon1>=<Y>, ...)
```

**Refuse-to-write gate.** If `M < N_union`, list every omitted method with a reason from the allowed set — each backed by a doc/source URL: `deprecated` / `admin-only` / `platform-specific (e.g. GraphQL-only)` / `node-client does not implement it (cite repo/docs URL)`. A probe/curl result (`-32601`, HTTP `501`/`404`/`5xx`, timeout) is **NOT** an allowed omission reason — keep the method and carry it on the watch-list. If any omission lacks a documented reason, ADD THE METHOD BACK before writing. Do NOT write until `M == N_union` OR every gap is justified.

Then validate one shape detail: for every `category.subscription: true` method, confirm a matching `parse_directive` exists in the same collection (rule D); add any missing one.

## Step 4 — Write `<chain>.json`

Write the single file `<chain>.json` (lowercase, matching the mainnet index lowercased). Structure matches `iota.json`:

```json
{
  "proposal": {
    "title": "Add Specs: <CHAIN>",
    "description": "<one-sentence description>",
    "specs": [
      { "index": "<CHAIN>", "name": "<chain> mainnet", "imports": [], ... },
      { "index": "<CHAIN_T>", "name": "<chain> testnet",
        "imports": ["<CHAIN>"],
        "api_collections": [{ ..., "apis": [], "verifications": [{ "name": "chain-id", "values": [{ "expected_value": "<testnet_hex>" }] }] }] }
    ]
  },
  "deposit": "10000000ulava"
}
```

Apply the resolved archive decisions passed in: include/omit the `archive` extension on mainnet and on testnet per the inputs, use the given `rule.block`, and set the `pruning` verification `expected_value` to the given value.

## Step 5 — Inheritance audit (CONDITIONAL)

Skip entirely if the mainnet draft's `imports` array is empty. If `imports != []`, perform the two-step audit from `references/phase3.1-inheritance.md`:

**Step 5a — Parent's APIs vs chain's documented APIs.**

```bash
PARENT="ETH1"  # or whatever the import is
PARENT_FILE="${PARENT,,}.json"   # specs live flat at repo root
jq -r '.proposal.specs[] | select(.index == "'$PARENT'") | .api_collections[].apis[].name' "$PARENT_FILE" | sort -u > /tmp/parent_methods.txt
# chain-docs methods from the research brief / methods file → /tmp/chain_methods.txt
comm -23 /tmp/parent_methods.txt /tmp/chain_methods.txt > /tmp/ghosts.txt
```

For each ghost (in parent but not chain docs), run an empirical curl probe against the public RPC (corroborating only — never decisive):

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"<ghost>","params":[],"id":1}' <chain_rpc_url>
```

**Disable rule — positive evidence required.** A **runtime probe result NEVER justifies disabling by itself**, regardless of what it returns: JSON-RPC `-32601`/`-32600`, HTTP `501`/`404`/`405`/`429`/`5xx`, connection error, or timeout are all free-tier/gateway artifacts — a paid/dedicated node may serve the method. HTTP `501 Not Implemented` from a public upstream is a *gateway* response, NOT proof the node lacks the method. Disable/remove a ghost ONLY with positive evidence of absence:
1. The chain's official docs EXPLICITLY state it is unsupported/removed/deprecated (cite URL), OR
2. The chain's node-client *source/docs* show it is not implemented (cite source URL — a code/doc finding, never a live status code).

Probe error but no positive-evidence source → retain inheritance, put the method on the watch-list. Probe returns anything other than an error → method exists; retain inheritance.

**Justification ledger (enforced).** For EVERY method/addon/collection set to `enabled: false`, append a row to `docs/<chain>/DISABLED_JUSTIFICATIONS.md`:

```
| <name> | docs-explicit | client-source | <URL> | <one-line quote> |
```

The Phase 11 final reviewer cross-checks `enabled: false` entries against this file; any disabled entry without a positive-evidence row is a CRITICAL finding.

**Step 5b — Chain-specific additions.**

```bash
comm -13 /tmp/parent_methods.txt /tmp/chain_methods.txt > /tmp/additions.txt
```

Every method in `/tmp/additions.txt` MUST appear in the child spec. Commonly missed: `admin_*`, `txpool_*`, `*_Sync` variants.

## Step 6 — jq validation

```bash
jq . <chain>.json > /dev/null; echo "jq exit: $?"
```

If non-zero, capture `jq . <chain>.json 2>&1 | head -n 20`, fix, and re-run until exit 0. Do NOT return `SPEC: WRITTEN` until jq exits 0.

## Return format (compact — never paste the spec body)

```
SPEC: WRITTEN | BLOCKED
calc-table:
<the Step 1 table>
pre-write-summary:
<the Step 3 counts block>
omissions: <none | list of method → reason+URL>
watch-list: <none | methods kept despite probe failure>
inheritance: <no imports | disabled: <list with evidence> | all retained>
path: <chain>.json
jq: valid
```

Use `BLOCKED` (with the reason) only if you cannot produce a jq-valid spec without a human decision the orchestrator did not supply — e.g. a >20% block-time disagreement with no resolution. Otherwise apply the conservative default, record it under the relevant line, and return `WRITTEN`.
